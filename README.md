# Behaviour Assertion Sheets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cgiffard/Behaviour-Assertion-Sheets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgiffard/Behaviour-Assertion-Sheets) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/cgiffard/Behaviour-Assertion-Sheets.png)](https://david-dm.org/cgiffard/Behaviour-Assertion-Sheets)

(For a friendlier overview, see http://bas.cgiffard.com/)

Behaviour Assertion Sheets (Bas, pronounced 'base') are a way to describe how a
web page fits together, make assertions about its structure and content, and be
notified when these expectations are not met. It's a bit like selenium, if you've
ever used that. An easier DSL for client-side integration testing.

You could:

*	Use BAS to [monitor the Apple Developer site to tell you when WWDC tickets
	are on sale](http://github.com/cgiffard/WWDC-Alerts), or your local postal
	service to tell you when a package has been delivered
*	Scan your site for common accessibility pitfalls, such as missing alt tags
	on images, poor heading order, or even check for hard-to-read copy with the
	inbuilt readability tests!
*	Monitor for service availability and downtime
*	Integration testing and integrity verification (plug Bas into jenkins or travis!)
*	Use BAS inside of an existing test framework like Mocha to verify output,
	or even as reporting middleware inside your express application

Anybody who has ever used CSS can use Bas - the [syntax is easy and familiar.]
(#sheet-syntax)

## Installing

This first implementation of Bas is built with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), so
you'll need it and npm first. Then just use npm to install Bas:

	npm install -g bas
	
Installing globally (`-g`) makes a [CLI tool](#bas-on-the-command-line) available
for working with Bas sheets. If you don't install globally you can still use Bas
via the [node.js API](#bas-nodejs-api).

## Sheet Syntax

As mentioned earlier, the Bas syntax looks very similar to (and nearly even parses as)
CSS. Here are the major components:

![Major components of the Bas syntax, as described by the list below.](http://cgiffard.com/github/bas/bas-diagram.png)

(You can work this out yourself and just want to skip to the goods?
[Jump to syntax example.](#bas-example))

#### Rulesets

Rulesets are the highest-level construct in Bas. Everything falls inside a ruleset.
There are two kinds of rulesets - page specific rulesets denoted by the tag `@page`,
and rulesets that execute against every page unconditionally, denoted by the
tag `@all`.

Syntactically these are based on the 'at-rules' of CSS (such as `@font-face`,
`@media`, etc.)

Rulesets cannot be nested.

An example rulset:

	@all {
		...
	}

#### Annotations

Annotations are an extension of CSS comments, that are prepended with an `@` symbol.
Bas knows to associate these with rulesets and selectors that follow, and displays
them in assertion failure traces so you know where they came from!

You may add as many annotations as you like to a single element. Every annotation
that precedes a block, regardless of whether assertions or regular comments (just
normal CSS comments without an `@`) are interspersed within them, is associated
with that block.

An example annotation:

	/*@ Here's my annotation! */

#### Conditions

A condition is appended to a page-specific ruleset (`@page`) and determines based
on the response information, URL of the page, and other environment variables,
whether the current page should be evaluated against this ruleset.

Conditions are additive and exclusive - each has to be true for the page to be
considered for testing against a given ruleset. You may add as many conditions
as you like to a `@page` ruleset.

Conditions are composed of a parentheses-wrapped set of three elements, each space
separated. On the left-hand side, a `test` - a reference to a function which
returns an environment variable or extracts an aspect of the current page or
server response.

The middle is an operator, which defines how the comparison takes place. An example
of an operator might be `=` or `>=` or `!=~`. A full list of operators can be
found in the [syntax glossary](#operators).

The rightmost component is the assertion value - a string, number, or regular
expression which is compared to the test according to the rules of the operator.

An example condition:

	@page (status-code = 301) { ... }

Multiple conditions may be combined like so:

	@page (status-code = 301) (content-type != text/html) { ... }
	
Remember that adding more conditions will make the match more *exclusive*, as
every single one must succeed for the ruleset to be evaluated.

#### Selector

A selector groups a block of assertions together, and executes them against every
node in a page that matches the selector string.

The selector string is formatted exactly like a regular CSS selector - tags, IDs,
classes, pseudoclasses, and attribute syntax are all the same.

The assertions wrapped within a selector block are only executed should the
selector match at least one node - with one exception: the special `required`
assertion [subject](#assertion-subject) which executes regardless of whether a
selector matches.

There's a caveat to this too, though: should a selector containing the `required`
assertion subject be nested inside another selector block which does not match
any nodes, it will not be executed. This allows syntax like the following:

```css
	h2 {
		h1 { required: true; }
	}
```

In this case, the heading 1 is required if one or more second-level headings
are present.

##### Nesting selectors

Selector blocks can be nested. If a selector block is nested within another, it
will only be executed should the parent selector match.

##### Scoping in Selectors

When selector blocks are nested, special scoping variables may be used.

###### $this

The scoping variable `$this` maps to the parent selector block's selector string.
Therefore, consider the following example:

```css
#content {
	$this b {
		/* Hey! */
	}
}
```

The inner selector `$this b` will map to `#content b`.

###### $node

The `$node` scope is similar to `$this` â€” however it is even more restrictive,
only searching within the exact node (or nodes) which was/were selected.

```css
#content header {
	$node h3 {
	
	}
}
```

In the above example, `$node h3` is equivalent to a scoped search for `h3` within
each individual element matching `#content header`.

##### Value Interpolation In Selectors

Selectors may contain values interpolated from test results executed in their
parent context.

For example, lets say you want to make sure that any element with an
`aria-describedby` attribute has a matching element ID somewhere on the page.

```css
/* ARIA attributes */
$this [aria-describedby] {
	/*@ WCAG (1.3.1 A, 4.1.1 A, 4.1.2 A) There must be a tag with a matching ID
		for the aria-describedby attribute */
	
	[id=$(attribute(aria-describedby))$] {
		count: 1;
		required: true;
	}
}
```

The `$(...)$` construct instructs Bas to execute the string
`attribute(aria-describedby)` as a test, and return the result, interpolating it
into the selector.

Therefore, the final interpolated selector might look like:

```css
[id=image-header]
```

#### Assertions

An assertion is very similar to a `declaration` in CSS. Fundamentally, it is a
semicolon delimited key-value pair, that unlike CSS, defines an expectation
rather than assigning a value.

The left-hand side of the assertion is known as the [subject](#assertion-subject)
of the assertion, and refers to a [test](#tests) - a function that returns a value
based on the content of the current page/request.

This value is then compared against the right-hand side of the assertion - which
can contain any number of match requirements, separated by commas and/or spaces.
These requirements are evaluated separately, and should any single one of them
fail (return a falsy value) the assertion will be considered `failed`.

Match requirements for an assertion can be strings, numbers, regular expressions,
negated regular expressions (prepended with !) or [barewords](#barewords).

An example of an assertion in use:

	attribute(style): contains("font-family");

#### Assertion Subject

The left-hand side of every assertion is known as an `assertion subject`, and
refers to a test function that returns a value from the current page or response
information. A list of these functions can be found in the [syntax glossary.]
(#tests)

An example of an assertion subject in use might be:

	title: /github/i;

In this case, the assertion subject is `title`. It refers to a test function called
`title` which extracts the current document title. This is returned for the regex
comparison on the right hand side of the assertion.

Some tests take arguments. This is how an assertion with test arguments is
represented:

	attribute(role): "main";

##### Subject Transformations

The value of an assertion test function can be subsequently transformed by special
functions known as [transform functions](#transform-functions).

These can be chained against the value of an assertion test using the delimiter `.`.

Purely for illustrative purposes, here's an example of using transform functions
(fictitious... for now) to rot-13 text from a node before validating the assertion:

	h1 {
		text.rot13: /* some match here... */
	}

Multiple transforms can be applied:

	h1 {
		text.rot13.rot13: /* text is back to normal! */
	}
	
And arguments can be provided to transform functions, just like to the subject test
itself.

	h1 {
		text.rot(13): /* some match here... */
		text.rot(13).rot(13): /* some match here... */
	}
	
A more realistic use-case can be found in the text-statistics functions. If you
want to check the flesch-kincaid reading ease of a given node, you could use:

	h1 {
		text.flesch-kincaid-reading-ease: gte(80);
	}

You could check the reading-ease of the alt-text on an image, too:

	img {
		attribute(alt).flesch-kincaid-reading-ease: gte(80);
	}

#### Barewords

The right-hand side of the assertion, as well as regular expression, numeric, and
string matches, can contain special keywords known as barewords (for their lack
of enclosing quotation marks.)

These keywords refer to a special function that by design has no access to the
document - just the value returned by the [assertion subject](#assertion-subject),
and any optional arguments it is given.

If the result of this function is falsy, then the assertion is considered `failed`.

A full list of barewords can be found in the [syntax glossary](#bareword-functions).

An example of barewords in use:

	attribute(user-id): exists, longer-than(1), gte(1);

### Bas Example

```css
	@page (title =~ /github/i) (domain = github.com) {
		
		status-code: 200;
		
		img[src*="akamai"] {
			required: true;
			attribute(alt): true;
			count: 3;
		}
		
		/*@ Require a heading 1 to be present if there's a heading 2 */
		h2 {
			h1 {
				required: true;
			}
		}
	}
	
	@all {
		status-code: lt(500);
	}
```

This example provides a fairly broad look at what Bas can do and how it works.

Let's break this example down bit by bit.

Given a page from the domain `github.com`, with a document title that matches the
regular expression `/github/i`:

*	Bas will check that the status code of the page matches the asserted `200 OK`.
*	Bas will select all images with `akamai` somewhere in the in the `src`
	attribute, and:
	*	Assert that at least one appears on the page
	*	Assert that each has an `alt` attribute
	*	Assert that exactly three should appear on the page if the selector matches
*	Bas will select every heading 2 (h2) on the page
	*	If there's at least one heading two on the page, Bas will select
		every heading 1 (h1), and:
			*	Assert that if a heading 2 is present, at least one heading 1
				should also be present on the page.

Then, on every page tested, Bas will check to see whether the status code of the
response was less than 500. 

## Syntax Glossary

### Operators

Operators are used in ruleset conditions, like `(title !=~ /github/i)`.

A full list follows:

* `=` true if `a == b`
* `!=` true if `a !== b`
* `=~` true if the regular expression `a` matches `b`
* `!=~` true if the regular expression `a` does not match `b`
* `>` true if `a > b` where both `a` and `b` are considered floats
* `<` true if `a < b` where both `a` and `b` are considered floats
* `>=` true if `a >= b` where both `a` and `b` are considered floats
* `<=` true if `a <= b` where both `a` and `b` are considered floats

### Tests

Tests without arguments may be used in ruleset conditions, like
`(title !=~ /github/i)`, or as assertion subjects with or without arguments, like
`attribute(role): "navigation"`.

## Bas on the Command Line

If you [installed Bas globally](#installing), you'll have access to a `bas` CLI
client which (hopefully) is available in your `$PATH`.

The `bas` CLI client can request a series of URLs, or initiate a crawl using the
provided list of URLs as a seed.

If you want to use Bas in another, non-JS project or in some kind of automated
capacity from the shell, you can supply a `-j` option to get test results as raw
JSON.

Here's a very simple example of how you might use the CLI tool:

	bas -vc -s mysheet.bas http://www.mywebsite.com/

In this example, the file `mysheet.bas` would be loaded and, with verbose reporting,
a crawl of mywebsite.com initiated (the `-c` option starts a crawl.) The test
suite would be run against every page returned, for as many pages as are present
and accessible from the given URL. Obviously it may make sense to limit the number
of pages downloaded: you can do this with the `-l` option:

	bas -vc -l 10 -s mysheet.bas http://mywebsite.com/

You may specify a single numeric range using a simple interpolation:
	
	bas -vc -l 10 -s mysheet.bas http://mywebsite.com/node/%{20-500}
	
If the `-s` option isn't specified, `bas` will look for the assertion sheet on
`STDIN`. Therefore, you can cat a file and pipe it to `bas` as well:

	cat mysheet.bas | bas -v http://mydomain.com/testfile.html

Or, if you haven't piped anything, `bas` will prompt you to enter the sheet
information manually:
	
	âž­  bas -v http://www.regex.info
	Waiting for BAS input from STDIN.
	@all {
		h1 { required; }
	}
	^D
	Thanks, got it.
	
	<snip>

Here's the full list of options supported by `bas` at this time: (you can also
get a list of options by typing `bas -h` at the prompt.)

* `-h`, `--help` Output usage information
* `-V`, `--version` Output the version number
* `-c`, `--crawl` Crawl from the specified URLs
* `-s`, `--sheet [filename]` Test using the specified BAS
* `-l`, `--limit [number]` Limit number of resources to request when crawling
* `-d`, `--die` Die on first error
* `-q`, `--quiet` Suppress output (prints final report/json only)
* `-v`, `--verbose` Verbose output
* `-j`, `--json` Output list of errors/test results as JSON
* `--csv` Output list of errors/test results as CSV
* `--noquery` Don't download resources with query strings
* `-u`, `--username <username>` Username for HTTP Basic Auth (crawl)
* `-p`, `--password <password>` Password for HTTP Basic Auth (crawl)

The exit value from the CLI is equivalent to the number of errors that occurred
when the test suite was run. If no errors occurred, of course, the exit value is
zero.

## Bas Node.js API

### Overview

The Bas API is extremely straightforward. To get started, simply require it:

```javascript
	var BAS = require("bas");
```

Create yourself a new BAS test suite like so:

```javascript
	var testSuite = new BAS();
```

Load in a Bas sheet (you can also supply a buffer if you'd prefer.)

```javascript
	testSuite.loadSheet("./mysheet.bas");
```
	
Then fetch a resource (in this case, we're using [request](http://npm.im/request))
and run the test suite against it. You'll need to pass in a URL and response object
as well as the page data.

```javascript
	request("http://example.com",function(err,res,body) {
		if (err) throw err;
		
		testSuite.run(url,res,data);
	});
```
	
The test suite runs asynchronously, and [emits events](#events) so you can know
when errors have occurred, assertions have been tested, or that the suite has
completed.

We can listen to one of these events to be alerted to when the test suite finishes,
and receive a list of errors (if there were any!)

```javascript
	testSuite.on("end",function() {
		if (testSuite.errors.length) {
			console.log("Looks like there were some errors!");
			testSuite.errors.forEach(function(err) {
				console.error(err.message);
			});
		}
	});
```

### API Reference

#### BAS (constructor)

	new BAS( [options] )

Returns a new Bas test suite instance. The optional `options` parameter is an
object, with the following possible keys:

*	`continueOnParseFail` (Defaults to `false`)
Should Cheerio fail to parse the HTML document, should Bas continue with the
test suite, loading in a blank document? Or bail out?

BAS is an instance of node EventEmitter and implements the `on` and `emit` methods,
not described here.

#### `BAS.tests` *property*

Getter: Returns an object map of functions corresponding to [tests](#tests.)

#### `BAS.errors` *property*

Getter: returns an array of assertion errors (Error instances) if any were thrown
during the previous test run.

Each error has the following (some additional) properties:
	
*	`message` (string - the error message.)
*	`selector` (string - if available, the selector that triggered the current
	assertion.)
*	`nodePath` (string - a generated, unambiguous CSS selector path to the current node.)
*	`url` (string - the url of the page that triggered this assertion.)

The list of errors may also be cleared with `BAS.errors.clear()`.

#### `BAS.rules` *property*

Getter: An array of ruleset objects. (Better documentation for these coming soon!)

#### `BAS.stats` *property*

Getter: Returns an object containing statistics about past test runs.

This should be considered **unstable** and undocumented. It is about to change.

#### `BAS.loadSheet` (buffer sheetData | string filePath)

If given a buffer, this function will not touch the filesystem - it simply parses the
data it receives immediately.

If given a filepath, asynchronously loads the entire file off disk, and parses
it - adding the processed rules to the test suite object.

These rules can be accessed via [`BAS.rules`](#basrules-property).

This function returns an object with promise handlers: `yep` for success, and `nope`
for failure. See the [yoyaku](http://github.com/cgiffard/yoyaku) documentation for
more information.

#### `BAS.parseSheet` (buffer sheetData | string sheetData)

Takes a string or a buffer containing Bas rules, and parses it, adding the
processed rules to the test suite object.

These rules can be accessed via [`BAS.rules`](#basrules-property).

This function returns an object with promise handlers: `yep` for success, and `nope`
for failure. See the [yoyaku](http://github.com/cgiffard/yoyaku) documentation for
more information.

#### `BAS.registerTest`(string testName, function test)

Registers a test in the `BAS.test` object map - and makes it available to Bas
sheets to use in conditions and assertion subjects.

#### `BAS.run` (string URL, object HTTPResponse, string Data)

Initiates the running of the test suite.

It is important to give this function the correct URL and response object, or the
tests may not operate correctly.

`BAS` will emit events during the execution of the tests.

This function returns an object with promise handlers: `yep` for success, and `nope`
for failure. See the [yoyaku](http://github.com/cgiffard/yoyaku) documentation for
more information.

### Events

*	`loadsheet`
	Emitted when a new Bas sheet is successfully loaded.
*	`testregistered` (name, func)
	Emitted when a new test is registered with Bas.
*	`start` (url)
	Emitted when the test suite commences.
*	`parseerror` (error)
	Emitted when Cheerio encounters a parse error with the resource.
*	`assertion` (assertion, [node])
	Emitted when Bas begins testing an assertion. The node parameter is only
	supplied when testing an assertion in a selector group.
*	`assertionsuccess` (assertion, [node])
	Emitted when Bas completes testing an assertion, and the result is truthy.
	The node parameter is only supplied when testing an assertion in a selector
	group.
*	`assertionfailed` (assertionErr, assertion)
	Emitted when Bas completes testing an assertion, and the result is falsy, and
	the test is considered failed. The error triggered by the assertion is supplied
	as the first parameter.
*	`selector` (selector, node)
	Emitted when Bas commences testing the assertions in a selector.
*	`startgroup` (rule)
	Emitted when Bas commences testing the assertions in a ruleset.
*	`end` (url,errors)
	Emitted when Bas completes the test suite. An array of errors is provided,
	and the URL of the page the tests were executed against.

## Roadmap

#### Next Version/s

*	Better documentation for rulesets, assertions, selector objects
*	Asynchronous test support
*	Comprehensive test suite (this is steadily improving!)
*	Very solid cleanup
*	Load in HTML/XML to test against from disk using `bas` CLI tool
*	Lots more test functions (for conditions and assertions)
*	Support for assertion-specific error severity

#### Further down the road

*	Support for headless browsers and PhantomJS

#### Under consideration

*	Cross compilation of Bas sheets to selenium

## Testing

Bas does not have an enormous test suite at this stage, but I'm working on filling
it out as comprehensively as possible.

To run the test suite, use:

	npm test
	
### Test Coverage

Test coverage is generated with [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/).

To generate current statistics, run `npm run-script coverage` from the Bas directory.
